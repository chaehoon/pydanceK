There are two licenses in this file. The old license is not active
anymore, but remains for clarification on my original intentions.

If you didn't notice, my new license is the "MIT" or X11 license. I would
still very much like to know if you use pyDance in any constructive way or
put it on any sort of game disc, but it's not required.

The file "clicked.ogg" in the sounds/ directory was taken from the GNOME
audio package, and is in the public domain.

The file "VL-PGothic-Regular.ttf" in the themes/font directory was
taken from the ttf-vlgothic Debian package, originally downloaded from
http://dicey.org/vlgothic . Its copyright information and terms of
distribution are appended at the end of this file.

The TextProgress object is by Pete Shinners, and is in the public domain.

----OLD LICENSE----
My license for pyDDR is simple.

I did not write or come up with DDR. DDR is owned by Konami. I did,
however, write all of the code in here and come up with the fileformat
for the STEP files. I really don't care if anyone wants to scour my code
for ideas, or learn from it, or improve on it. My art sucks, but if you
really want to use it for something, be my guest.

My own original music is included with pyDDR. Obviously, since my music is
distributed with pyDDR and pyDDR is free, so is my music. I don't grant
any permission for people to claim my music as their own, but I'd love to
hear from you if you like the songs. I don't charge for my music, I just
want people to know I wrote it and it's mine.

Although not required, I humbly ask that you let me know if my project is
included with anyone's compilation or on another website, or whatever. If
anything is unclear, I am contactable at tgz at orotech dot net
