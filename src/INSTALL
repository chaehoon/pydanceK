pydance INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------------------

pydance currently is known to run on Windows, Unix and GNU/Linux, and
Mac OS X systems. In theory, it will run anywhere Pygame and Python do.
pydance can be gotten from http://www.icculus.org/pyddr/get.php.

This is the short version of the installation instructions. More detailed
help (like how to install all the strange kinds of files pydance supports)
can be found in docs/manual.html.

In all installations, you need the following things:
 - A sufficiently recent SDL.
 - The [currently] latest SDL_mixer (1.2.5), with Vorbis support.
 - SMPEG, if you want bad MP3 support.
 - Libvorbis.
 - Python 2.3 or higher.
 - Pygame 1.5.6 or higher (1.5.5 is acceptable but may crash on some files).

If you are running a Unix distribution, all these probably come with
your OS. Otherwise, you can find them at http://www.libsdl.org,
http://www.xiph.org, http://www.python.org, and http://www.pygame.org.

Installing under Unix or GNU/Linux
----------------------------------
 $ python setup.py
 $ su -c 'make install'

The first step checks to make sure you have appropriate versions of
Python and Pygame installed. The second one copies files into the
appropriate places on your system (according to the GNU/Linux FHS).

If you need to install it somewhere else, you can set DESTDIR (to
install to an alternate root entirely), or PREFIX (which is /usr/local
by default).

The default configuration file looks in /usr/share/games/pydance/songs,
/usr/local/share/games/pydance/songs, and ~/.pydance/songs for Ogg/MP3
and step files.

Installing under Windows
------------------------
 X:\pydance> python setup.py

That's it. Copy your song and step files to the same directory as pydance,
or to a ..\songs directory.

Optional Stuff
--------------
pydance needs to convert a few odd encodings, like CP949, that aren't
in the base Python installation. pydance will run without it, but your fonts
will render incorrectly (they probably will anyway, since good free
Korean/Japanese fonts are lacking). This means you should install
http://sourceforge.net/projects/koco, which contains the CP949 iconv
codec.

If you have the Psyco optimizing compiler installed (http://psyco.sf.net),
pydance will use it by default. Set 'usepsyco' to 0 to turn it off, which
you'll need to do to report bugs. Psyco may give pydance a good speed boost,
but it is IA32-only currently.

Troubleshooting
---------------
If you are having trouble with pydance, first check your OS distributor
for updates. Debian and Gentoo GNU/Linux both have packages for pydance,
and this is the recommended installation method for these systems.
Also, visit http://www.icculus.org/pyddr/get.php and see if a new version
has been released, or if there is a package for your platform. If that
fails, drop by #pyddr on irc.freenode.net and see if anyone knows how
to help you. However, if you ask for help, expect to answer a lot of
questions about your OS and the software on it. In addition, if your
OS is non-free (Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, BeOS, or any of the non-free
Linux distributions), and the problem is OS-specific, we won't be able to
help.
