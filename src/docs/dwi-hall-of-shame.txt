For those of us who hate the DWI format (which is everyone who ever
tried to write a parser for it), I present the DWI Hall of Shame,
where I mention personal information about people who write the
stupidest possible files ever.

TournaMix 2, "Peanuts Theme" by Eithug <eirthug@comcast.net>, AIM
E1rt4u9. This file contains the phrase '...B!(60...'. What does this
mean? Jump and then a 16th note later start to hold? Jump and then
hold the left parenthesis? It's nonsense.

DJ Taka's "M" by Christopher Emirzian <udder@rydia.net>, which
contains a BPM change at the beat "894.8.3". The hell?

Chris Danford, for the oh-so-classic Stepmania editor bug. This
results in holds like '0!B' for a left+right jump and hold, or '4!6'
for only holding the right arrow, which makes even less sense.

And of course, SimWolf <simwolf_dwi@hotmail.com>, for inventing a
format that's so braindead. Thanks for the lack of a formal grammar,
no encoding information, and double meanings of : and #, and writing
proprietary code that somehow manages to parse all the absolute 
*SHIT* above.

Oh, and for totally changing the meaning of <...> between versions to
make it backwards and forwards incompatible.
